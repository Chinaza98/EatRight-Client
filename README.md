Eat Right

## Overview

Eat Right is a website that provides healthy meal options for people with dietary restrictions inclusing the recipes.

### Problem

Many people with dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, or diabetic-friendly) struggle to find diverse, healthy meal options that cater to their specific needs. Most people lack knowledge about what constitutes a healthy meal for their dietary restrictions or how to prepare such meals, people have to rely on costly pre-packaged meals marketed as “diet-friendly”. While recipes are widely available, people may struggle to sift through irrelevant or unverified options, making a dedicated platform appealing.
